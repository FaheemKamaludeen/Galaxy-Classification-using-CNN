# Galaxy Classification using Convolutional Nueral Networks
Galaxy images are classified into Spiral or Elliptical galaxies with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks. Galaxies can be split into 3 categories which include
Spiral, Elliptical and Irregular. Irregular Galaxies are ignored for this project because of the lack of data. Despite using only 20% of the data due to system 
capabilities, an accuracy of 77% was achieved.


The data is obtained from Galaxy Zoo 2 which includes over 300,000 galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations.
